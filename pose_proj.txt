In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the overall
economic losses owing to increasing traffic congestion. For
instance, the total time lost owing to traffic congestion in
Japan in 2012 was approximately 5 billion hours per year [1].
The economic loss in terms of total lost time is estimated to
be approximately 10 trillion yen per year, and it is calculated
by converting cash wages in 2012 to time [2]. Therefore,
because the economic benefits of reducing traffic congestion
are significant, it is necessary to address this issue

Therefore, there is a need to realize
a traffic signal control system (TSCS) that automatically
obtains a better control law considering multiple factors using
deep reinforcement learning
